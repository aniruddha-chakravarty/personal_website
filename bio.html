<h1> Stuff that excites me ! </h1>
  
<p>  At the time of writing this, I believe the following elements take up most of my “mindspace” in some form or another. <br />
  
  
     In no particular order, they are as follows:   </p>

<ul>  
<li> Data Mining: algorithms for making sense of vast amounts of data </li>
<li> AI and Machine Learning: building systems that “learn” by themselves </li>
<li> Psychology and philosophy of “learning” in humans </li> 
<li> Distributed computing: writing programs that harness the maximum potential of clusters of computers </li>
<li> Economics, human motivations, and the structures and complexities of the globalized world </li>
<li> Effective management, leadership, and how to get things done </li>
<li> TED, Quora and crowdsourced knowledge. And lest I forget THE BEST site on this planet - reddit :) </li>
<li> Bicycles, cars and anything that moves in general. This includes ANYTHING and EVERYTHING that moves. Including animals. :)</li>
<li> Urban Exploration and roaming about hunting for abandoned structures </li>     
</ul>
