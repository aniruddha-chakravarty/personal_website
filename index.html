<p> Hola, kind Internet stranger! This is my personal homepage. <br /> Think of it as my own corner in the vast unending void that is the Internet. </p> 

<p> If you've made it to this page simply because you were either a recruiter, or a well wisher <br /> or simply someone who stumbled on this page randomly, 
you're welcome here to simply view my viewpoints on certain programming topics and life topics in general. </p>


<p> To start with, I am in my junior year at MIT in Pune. In university, I've taken up subjects <br /> that are extremely diverse in terms of their characteristics, ranging from Microprocessors and Assembly language, right upto the humanities, with a bit of Linear Algebra + Calculus mixed in this motley mixture.
