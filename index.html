<p> Hola! This is my personal homepage. 
Think of it as my own corner in the vast unending void that is the Internet. </p>

<p> If you've made it to this page simply because you were either a recruiter, or a well wisher, or simply someone who stumbled on this page randomly, 
you're welcome here to simply view my viewpoints on certain programming topics and life topics in general. </p>

<p> To start with, I am a computer science undergrad at MIT in Pune.
