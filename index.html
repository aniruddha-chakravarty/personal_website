<p> Hola, kind Internet stranger! This is my personal homepage. <br /> Think of it as my own corner in the vast unending void that is the Internet. 

If you've made it to this page simply because you were either a recruiter, or a well wisher, or simply someone who stumbled on this page randomly, 
you're welcome here to simply view my viewpoints on certain programming topics and life topics in general. 

To start with, I am in my junior year at MIT in Pune. In university, I've taken up subjects that are extremely diverse, ranging from Microprocessors and Assembly language <br /> to the humanities, with a bit of Linear Algebra, Calculus mixed in this motley mixture.
